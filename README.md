Write a menu-driven JAVA program that performs the following array/vector operations: a) Reverse the sequence of elements in an array/array list. For instance, if the array/array list contains 1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11, after choosing this option, the array/array list will contain 11 9 4 7 9 16 9 4 1. b) Append one array/array list to another. For instance, if a is 1 4 9 16 and b is 9 7 4 9 11, after choosing this option the following will be returned: 1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11 c) Merge two array/array list, alternating elements from both. If one is shorter than the other, append the remaining elements from the longer array/array list. For instance, if a is 1 4 9 16 and b is 9 7 4 9 11, after choosing this option, the following will be returned: 1 9 4 7 9 4 16 9 11. d) Remove duplicates from an aray/array list. For instance, if the array/array list contains 1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11, after choosing this option, the array/array list will contain 1 4 9 16 7 11. Your Main should display a menu with the following options: – Enter first array/array list – Enter second array/array list – Reverse array/array list – Append array/array list – Merge array/array list – Remove duplicate from array/array list
